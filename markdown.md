# Project - TODO List App

This app was created as a part of the **#100daysofcode** challenge to develop my JavaScript skills to push my analytical and logical limit. While creating the app and integrating the javascript functionality, I had the opportunity to learn some concepts like ***localStorage and its methods[getItem & setItem]***  **, DOM manipulation** **and array traversal**.

## Purpose

The app was created as a replica of a todolist app with all the necessary features and functionality for the user. User could type something into the input, then click enter to submit, then it's added as a list to front end.

Data saves after reloading the the webpage or closing the browser with the aid the storing data into the local storage.
